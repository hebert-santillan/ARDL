# Autoselection of optimal lag selection 

This repository provides a Python implementation of an algorithm for **automatic lag selection in Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) models**. The tool is designed to assist on research in identifying the optimal lag structure for ARDL models, facilitating time series analysis and econometric modeling.

## Features
- Automatic selection of lags for both endogenous and exogenous variables.
- Support for standard information criteria (AIC, BIC) for lag selection.
- Efficient computation using NumPy and statsmodels.
- Easy integration into existing time series workflows.
  
## Module Versions
The algorithm was developed and tested using the following versions:

- Python: 3.8.8
- NumPy: 1.23.x
- Statsmodels: 0.14.x
- Pandas: 2.0.x
